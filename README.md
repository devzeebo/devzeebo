# Welcome! I'm Eric Siebeneich

I'm a Arch Linux enthusiast with a passion for clean code, BDD, and systems
design. In my role as a Technical Director at [Improving](https://improving.com)
I get the opportunity to work with amazing consultants and help guide the next
generation of developers.

Currently I'm focused on building our React and Front-End practices which I'm
enjoying immensely. In my spare time, I manage a homelab Kubernetes cluster for
hosting home automation and selfhosted apps.
